    Warnings for overlapping relationships detected by
    :meth:`sqlalchemy.orm.configure_mappers` will now emit a fully qualified
    relationship name, consisting of ``ClassName.RelationshipAttribute``, not
    just the relationship attribute.  To silence warnings,
    :paramref:`sqlalchemy.orm.relationship.overlaps` will now accept the fully
    qualified relationship name, not just the relationship attribute.
