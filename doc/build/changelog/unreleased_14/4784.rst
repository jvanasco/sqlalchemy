    Added support for a new :paramref:`_schema.MetaData.naming_convention`, 
    `type_ck`.
    
    The `CheckConstraint` created by `Boolean` and `Enum` columns is a so-called
    "type-bound" constraint, and often needs a different naming convention than
    other constraints.

	Exception messages generated by `create_table` when there related errors are
	also improved.
